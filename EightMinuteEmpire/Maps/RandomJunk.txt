Part 2: Map loader
Implement a group of C++ classes that reads and loads a map file in the .map text file format
(generated from the project resources). The map loader must be able to read any of Eight-Minute
Empire game such map. The map loader should store the map as a graph data structure (see Part
1). The map loader should be able to read any text file (even ones that do not constitute a valid
map). All the classes/functions that you implement for this component must all reside in a single
.cpp/.h file duo named MapLoader.cpp/MapLoader.h. You must deliver a file named
MapLoaderDriver.cpp file that contains a main function that reads various files and successfully
creates a map object for valid map files, and rejects invalid map files of different kinds.
Requirements part 2:
? Map loader can read any Eight-Minute Empire map file.
? Map loader creates a map object as a graph data structure (see Part 1).
? Map loader should be able to read any text file (even invalid ones).
? Driver reads many
